		<title>System specification and details</title>

		<p>The Southern Technical Institute for Natural Knowledge is a medium-sized tertiary education provider (founded in 1982) that teaches papers across many subjects, which lead to several different qualifications. They are currently in the process of designing and implementing a new student records database. The requirements analysis phase of the project is complete, and you have been brought in as lead database developer. It will be your task to implement an initial prototype of the database specification resulting from the requirements analysis phase. An ERD of the proposed database is shown in <hyperlink label="fig:erd"><reference label="fig:erd" /></hyperlink>, and more detailed specifications of the database requirements may be found in the following sections.</p>

If we use the existing values, this can even be done without breaking the specification!</p>

				<p indent="no">The subtype hierarchy seemed to confuse a few people. The most common example of this was, e.g., including both <code>Person_ID</code> and <code>Staff_ID</code> in <code>Staff</code>. This is unnecessary because they should be the same value anyway, and a column can appear in both the primary key and a foreign key at the same time. Also make sure that the foreign keys are referring to the correct tables as specified in the ERD (e.g., <code>Supervisor_ID</code> should reference <code>Staff</code>, not <code>Person</code>).</p>
				
				<p>It’s important when implementing “Boolean” style columns such as <code>International</code> in <code>Student</code> and <code>Release</code> in <code>Assessment</code> that you’re consistent in the values that you use across all such columns (more precisely, all such columns should have the same domain). A few people did something like implement one column as <code>'T', 'F'</code> and the other as <code>'True', 'False'</code>, or even more subtle, <code>'t', 'f'</code> (remembering that SQL string comparsion is case sensitive). Using inconsistent domains for columns that should have the same domain could lead to subtle bugs later on.</p>
				
				<p>A few people implemented something like <code>'T', 'F', 't', 'f'</code> on the seemingly reasonable theory that it was more “flexible”. (One person even included <code>'Y', 'N', 'y', 'n', '0', 1'</code>!) This kind of “flexibility” usually causes more problems than it solves, unfortunately. The main problem is that it’s now harder to write queries to find all the (for example) “true” values: we either have to test for all the possible permutations of “true”, or we have convert everything to the same format before comparing. Either way it's a pain to implement, and easy to get wrong. Keep things as simple as possible! You’ll thank yourself later.</p>
				
				<p>This of course is really a consequence of not having a proper <code>BOOLEAN</code> data type in SQL. There was a period where <OracleServer /> release 1 could create columns of type <code>BOOLEAN</code>, but this must have been unintentional, as it was never documented, and it no longer works as of <OracleServer /> release 2. The only place you can use <code>BOOLEAN</code> in <OracleServer /> is in its built-in database programming language, PL/SQL. The inconsistency of implementation of a Boolean data type across various DBMSs means that it’s generally safer to use the approach above if portability is important.</p>
				
				<p>Once again, we could use a lookup table for <code>Staff.Rank</code>.</p>

				<item>The <code>Raw_Mark</code> attribute stores the raw mark awarded for an assessment. Its value should be  between zero and the value of <code>Assessment.Maximum_Mark</code> (note that only the lower bound is required for this assignment—bonus marks if you can also implement the upper bound).</item>
				
				<item>The value of the <code>Weighted_Mark</code> attribute is calculated by the formula: <line-break />
				<code>Raw_Mark</code> / <code>Assessment.Maximum_Mark</code><space /> <times /><space /> <code>Assessment.Weight</code>.</item>
				
				<item>The value of the <code>Percentage_Mark</code> attribute is calculated by the formula: <line-break />
				<code>Raw_Mark</code> / <code>Assessment.Maximum_Mark</code><space /> <times /> 100.</item>
				
				<item>Note that the calculations for <code>Weighted_Mark</code> and <code>Percentage_Mark</code> are <emph>not</emph> constraints and should not be implemented as such! You may attempt to implement these calculations if you feel confident in your ability to do so, but please ensure that you complete the rest of the assignment <em>first</em>.</item>

				<p indent="no">Quite a few people got the sizes of the various <code>NUMBER</code> columns incorrect. Remember that the number of decimal places is <em>included</em> in the total number of digits, not <em>in addition to</em>. </p>
				
				<p>We also accepted <code>FLOAT</code>, <code>DOUBLE</code> (although it’s really overkill), <code>BINARY_FLOAT</code> and <code>BINARY_DOUBLE</code> for <code>Weighted_Mark</code>. Anything with a fixed length or number of decimal places was marked down, as this is a <em>fixed</em> point number, not a floating point number. The whole point (!) is that the precision and decimal places should adjust to what’s required at the time.</p>
				
				<p>As a couple of students discovered, <OracleServer /> now supports <em>virtual columns</em> that are computed by a formula, which opens the possibility of automatically computing the values of <code>Weighted_Mark</code> and <code>Percentage_Mark</code>. Unfortunately, virtual columns expressions can’t refer to columns in other tables, so the only way we can achieve this is to duplicate the <code>Maximum_Mark</code> and <code>Weight</code> columns from <code>Assessment</code> into <code>Result</code>. This could actually be useful in practice, however, as would enable us to vary the weight and maximum mark on a per-submission basis (perhaps to cater for students who were unable to complete the entire assignment due to unusual circumstances). We could use a trigger that runs before an <code>INSERT</code> on <code>Result</code> to copy across the “default” values from <code>Assessment</code>. <code>Result</code> could then look something like this:</p>
